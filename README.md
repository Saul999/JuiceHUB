# <span class="mark">The JuiceHub</span>

By: Saul Ruiz

Abstract:

My project, “The JuiceHub” is inspired by the website Genius.com, which
allows users to learn and contribute information on any song they like.
The demo allows users to access information, contribute to songs, and
create an account.

Methodology:

I followed 2-week sprints and had specific features I wanted to be
finished during that time frame. After every 2 weeks, I looked at what
my priorities were and put them in order during those sprints.

Conclusion:

The JuiceHub is an accomplishment to my younger self for creating this
project I thought of back in 2019. I plan on continuing this project
while making some changes to better optimize the site with more user
interactions, faster loading times, and better user authentication.

# Introduction

## Product Description

> The JuiceHub is an interactive and informative website about the late
> artist Juice WRLD. This platform aims to compile comprehensive data
> for each of his songs, offering users a detailed insight into the
> artist's musical legacy.

## Project Description

> I started working on the JuiceHub app on 2/7. I used agile methodology
> doing 2-week sprints and continuously worked on it till the present
> day and will do so in the future.

# Summary of Results

## Overall Assessment

> I completed many goals, such as displaying all song data from a
> backend to my front end and creating a user authentication and a
> contribution feature. Some features can be improved with functionality
> or design but still get the job done such as the admin feature, I'm
> the only one that can change the information for each song. I added
> some other features for users which are WIP since they were thought of
> later on such as an Add Song feature. User-to-user interactions is the
> part I didn't get to finish such as user profiles, comments, and
> friends. It was easy at first and very fun, then later on, it got
> harder to implement what I wanted to, which stalled progress in trying
> different ways to implement my vision.

## Reason for Changes from Proposal

I added Firebase for authentication but still used MongoDB for the
database. Firebase was a safer, more secure way to manage user's
passwords and uses Google’s password requirements.

## Summary of Built Product

Users can search through a database of 800+ songs which provides them
not only just the name but the date recorded, information about the
song, the album (aka era) when the song was recorded, its leaked status,
and producers. Users are also able to contribute to a song by sending in
any information they have to me in order to update the song.

## Most Significant Insight and Learning

> This project increased my understanding a lot. Instead of just copying
> tutorials, I used what I had learned in the past and applied it to my
> app. This was my first time creating a REST API and doing a full-stack
> project, including not just building but even deploying both my
> backend and frontend and ensuring they are successfully connected. My
> knowledge of Typescript increased tremendously throughout these
> months,o from basic understanding to learning about JSX, more on types
> and models, controllers, and routes.

## Hardest Technical Part

I created the contribution feature because it involved user
authentication, and it took a lot of work to implement it the way I
wanted to do it initially. I heard Firebase was very easy to use, and it
was to create users, but I needed clarification about implementing
Firebase with Mongo to save user data. I was stuck on this for a long
time trying to implement Firebase with Mongo, then went to just Mongo
alone, which ended up with me needing more time to finish it because I
still had other features to finish. I ended up using Firebase user IDs
and using the ID to store it when I needed to in Mongo.

# Comparison with Proposal

## Shape and Speed of Completion

Most of the completion occurred in the beginning. The tasks began
getting more complex and took more time to finish. To finish 1 task
involved hours of learning even to implement what I wanted to do in my
specific needs.

## Specific Differences Between Proposal Plan and As-Built

> I changed the name technicality of “reviews” to “contributions,” but
> it remains the same feature. Added an “Add Song” feature that is still
> a WIP, but thought it would be beneficial to the site. Users' comments
> and the top 5 songs and friends were not added.

### Goals

> My goals overall remained the same. I want to put out the functional
> parts of the project before the user-to-user interaction.

### Difficulty and Complexity

> Choosing Typescript over just regular Javascript increased complexity
> and caused plenty more errors and changes that I would have to do but
> wouldn't have to in regular JS. It was hard to choose what
> technologies to use for specific features I wanted to implement.

### Effort and Time Spent

> Effort and time spent decreased over time, especially throughout
> March, but picked up again in mid-April to complete what I needed to.
> I still spent an appropriate amount of time on it every two weeks, but
> during February I spent a lot more time on it.

### Technology

> Technology remained the same for the most part; I had to make a final
> decision between MongoDB and Postgres. After using each I chose
> mongoDB in the end.

### Completed Features and Areas

Display a list of songs being able to add, remove, or edit them in a
database and will update the list live. Created users and a profile
page. Users can submit a contribution and send it to the backend, where
I can update the songs using all the contributions that have been sent.

## Faulty Assumptions

Firebase was the answer to all my Auth troubles… It was great but would
have been better if I just used Firestore alone and completely ignored
MongoDB or vice versa. Another one would be that using Typescript
wouldn't be that much harder than using just JS. It caused a lot of
bumps in the road, types can be very tedious especially since I'm
getting them from the backend and creating specific interfaces with
multiple different types in 1 interface. I also realized the tech stack
does not matter because you can make it work with any stack as long as
you learn what you are working with and understand how you will be able
to implement it.

## Eventualized Risks

Using Firebase to use their auth became a problem since I did not want
to use Firestore and wanted everything in MongoDB. This caused me to
delay all user-to-user features since it all relied on User
authentication and storage. Type errors with the data using redux,
working with users, and creating Interfaces.

# Learnings and Adaptations

> I reinforced my knowledge of React, including Hooks, Routing, and
> Typescript. Also learned about MongoDB, which included learning about
> Postman to test my APIs. I learned more about Node and Express and
> what they can do individually and more about Firebase authentication.

## Goals

> Create a comprehensive backend with all the song information I
> currently have. Design an easy-to-use front end with a lot of
> simplicity. Add Users to be able to log in and send contributions.

## Optimism

I enjoyed working on this project; it's something I have wanted to build
since I was in high school, but I didn't have the skills to do it. It's
something that I will always want to continue to work on, so features
that need to be simplified or something I didn't get to will be
something I want to finish in the future to complete this project.

## Pressure

I felt little pressure since I completed a lot early on to avoid
procrastination and the stress of waiting. Since I did a lot during the
beginning any type of pressure left then.

## Prioritization

Creating the song database and displaying all the results was the
priority because that serves the most critical part of the app providing
the information to anyone that needs it. Then, users could give me with
any type of information about any specific song with a click of a
button, which was also a big priority.

## Process

I tried to work on features weekly and reviewed the whole project with
these features completed every 2. It helped me fully understand where I
was.

## Technology

I used MERN stack, MongoDB for the backend, Nodejs, Expressjs, and React
for the front end. I also used Firebase for user authentication, but I
am working on another way.

## Deployment

Backend:

## UI/UX

I used React Bootstrap to help build my components using the custom
components. React Bootstrap helped me build a responsive navbar, use
custom cards, buttons, and forms, and helped me with the layout using
rows and cols.

# Description of As-Built Product

## Features and Limitations

Users can search and scroll through a database of around 800 different
and unique songs, with each song having a clickable link to send them to
that song's specific page. Users can log in with their GitHub or Google
account and send a contribution for a song. It will automatically send
the song to me, and I can review and update it.

## Deployment

[<u>https://juice-hub-final.vercel.app/</u>](https://juice-hub-final.vercel.app/)

## Quality

This current deployment has a simple and easy-to-use design. Not too
many pages for the user. The song list could be improved with pagination
or infinite scroll preferably instead of just displaying all 774 songs
at once which can delay loading time. Also when you are logged in and
click on the add song or contribution page it will render the login
button/prompt before it switches to the actual page content that it
should. I need to learn more about conditional rendering and find a fix.

# Results of Product Usage

## Deployment

It is deployed through the web and anyone can access it. No one has to
create an account to access the information but to send contributions
you would have to create an account.

## Users

I asked a couple of classmates to try the website and test it out. They
are all CS majors, so they are tech-savvy and know about the technology
used. They tested the contributions feature, and it worked great.
Profiles weren't working too well, but they weren't done, and that's
where most of the feedback came from.

## User Feedback

1\. Label not done features as WIP

2\. Delete any hardcoded areas

3\. Song data takes a while to display on the first load

4\. The search bar clears when you hit enter

## Plans for Continuation

I do plan to keep working on this project. I want to keep building it as
a legitimate archive of the artist's music. Once I feel satisfied with
it, I want to make a bigger version of it with any/every artist the
community wants. I want to create a go to website for leaked/unreleased
music and just an extensive archive for music in general. This will be a
separate project from the JuiceHub

## Recommendations for Change

## Process

Staying more consistent at times, learning would be less frequent since
I already know a bit more than I did before so time will be spent on
building more features faster. I would like to create a better plan and
follow it because I got slightly off track working on features.

## Technology

Exclude Firebase and do user authentication on MongoDB or switch to
Firestore. Using both together made it more challenging than it
should've been.

## Prioritization

I would prioritize the same features such as displaying the song data,
creating a contribution feature for users then all the user interactions
after those core functionalities to the site.

## Deployment

I would stay with Vercel for the front end because it didn't give me any
errors, unlike Netlify and Railway, and it always redeploys
automatically after any changes to my GitHub repo. I would also stick
with render for the backend.

## UI/UX

The custom React bootstrap components helped with responsiveness, but I
tried Tailwind a bit throughout this year and liked it a lot. It would
help me design a better site fast and would be more unique. Using
react-bootstrap components makes the site look more basic/beginner. I
would want to fix this by using tailwind and sticking to my design
before.
